# Working through a Python coding challenge at pythonchallenge.com
0. This one was pretty easy.
1. I worked through this one with a custom character-shifting algorithm, then made another with the suggested solution.
2. To do this, I used vim to save the hidden text, as Atom didn't seem to like it.
3. Just used a slightly different regex. Also opened the file and read it in one step, I don't know if this is better.
